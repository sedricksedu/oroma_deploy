# TV Oroma Website

## Overview

This is a modern, responsive website for TV Oroma, a media house and television station based in Northern Uganda. The application is built as a full-stack web application with a React frontend and Express.js backend, designed to showcase the station's programming, news content, and community engagement.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation between frontend and backend concerns:

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and bundling
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom styling

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API Pattern**: RESTful API design
- **Development**: Hot reload with Vite integration

## Key Components

### Frontend Structure
- **Pages**: Home, Watch Live, Programs, Newsroom, About, Events, Media, Donate, Contact
- **Layout**: Shared navigation and footer components
- **Components**: Reusable UI components using shadcn/ui
- **Styling**: Custom CSS variables for Oroma TV branding (red, black, white theme)

### Backend Structure
- **Routes**: API endpoints for programs, news, events, contacts, and subscriptions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM for persistent data storage
- **Storage**: Abstract storage interface with PostgreSQL implementation
- **Middleware**: Request logging and error handling

### Shared Schema
- **Database Models**: User, Program, News, Event, Contact, Subscriber
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for type-safe data validation
- **Types**: Shared TypeScript types between frontend and backend

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: Frontend makes API calls using TanStack Query
2. **Server Processing**: Express routes handle requests and interact with storage layer
3. **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL database with persistent data storage via Drizzle ORM
4. **Response**: JSON responses sent back to client
5. **UI Updates**: React components re-render based on query state changes
